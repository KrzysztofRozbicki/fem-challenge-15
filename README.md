## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was very educational - the mobile and tablet designs seems easy , but it all started to
fall apart on desktop version. Now I know to spend more time analyzing the design and apply best
solution for all responsive versions.

### Continued development

Would like to learn many techniques about the responsive designs.
